# I want to make available particular coursepacks to users
#
#Background: articles have been added to the database
#  Given I have an account
# And I am on the article/coursepack search page
# And I follow the "New Course pack" page
# Then I should see "New Course Pack"
#

#Scenario: feature prebundled coursepacks
#	And I should see an option to feature prebundled coursepacks
#	But regular users should not
#
#Scenario: set price of prebundled coursepacks
#	And I should see an option to set the price of prebundled coursepacks
#	But regular users should not
#
#Scenario: edit prebundled coursepacks options

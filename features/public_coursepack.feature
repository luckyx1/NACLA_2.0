Feature: Allow a user's course packs to be publicly accessible to other users
	As a user
	So that I can choose whether or not I want to share the course packs I have created
	I want to set certain course packs as either public or private

Scenario: When I set a coursepack to public, it should be searchable by other users

Scenario: When I set a coursepack to private, it should not be searchable by other users

Scenario: Public coursepacks should have name of user who created it.
